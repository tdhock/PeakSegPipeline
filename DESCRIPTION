Title: Genome-Wide Peak Prediction Using Supervised Learning and Optimal Segmentation
Version: 2021.9.24
Author: Toby Dylan Hocking
Maintainer: Toby Dylan Hocking <toby.hocking@r-project.org>
Description: Implementations of supervised machine learning
 algorithms for peak detection in genomic data, as described in
 Hocking and Bourque (2020) <doi:10.1142/9789811215636_0033>.
 Functional Pruning Optimal Partitioning with up-down constraints,
 Hocking et al. (2018) <arXiv:1810.00117>
 is used for single-sample peak prediction
 (independently for each sample and genomic problem).
 A fast heuristic discrete segmentation algorithm,
 Hocking and Bourque (2015) <arXiv:1506.01286>
 is used for joint peak prediction
 (for each peak, jointly using all samples).
